<h1><i>Abe,</i></h1>
I know you barely know me other than the short conversations we've been having on twitter, but I wanted to write you this note just to let you know how much you've helped me.  Your videos on YouTube have been a real inspiration to me.  I managed to come across them at a time when I was feeling quite down in the dumps.  You've shown me that I'm not alone, and that I've never been alone with the problems that I have.  Thank you.  I know you haven't really wanted to get in touch with the public that much (especially not people on the internet who you hardly know), but if you could DM on twitter or something I'd like to be able to get in touch with you on IM or Skype or something like that.  I think it would be kinda cool to have someone to talk to.  Thanks for taking the time to actually read all this, I tried to make it as short, sweet, and to the point as possible.
